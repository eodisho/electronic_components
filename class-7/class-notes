What is coding and what is programming?

A program is a ordered list of instructions.  Code is a way to express those instructions.  A program exists for the human, the human designs the task with some goal in mind.  The comptuer does not care, it will only execute the list of instructions.  The code is the expression of those instructions in a way the computer can unambiguously execute.
